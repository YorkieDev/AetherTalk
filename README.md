## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) running and ready to party (Startup server mode, ensure CORS is ON, load a Large Language model and an embedding model, and you're ready to go, easy as 1 2 3!)
- A web browser (preferably from this century)
- Basic knowledge of the command line (don't worry, we'll be gentle)

### Quick Start

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YorkieDev/AetherTalk
   ```
2. Slide into the project directory:
   ```
   cd AetherTalk
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser and watch the magic happen!

## 🛠 Customization

Want to make AetherTalk truly yours? Dive into `script.js` and tweak:

- Server URL (in case your AI lives somewhere exotic)
- API key (for those fancy, exclusive AIs)
- Model name (because your AI deserves a cool name too)
- System message (set the mood for your AI conversations)
